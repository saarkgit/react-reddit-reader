# React/Reddit Project

This is a personal project I worked on to learn [React](https://reactjs.org/) and gain experience with interacting and displaying online data.

/r/Jokes subreddit with the second post clicked on to show its content.

## Additional Info
- The code brings in the first 10 posts from the 'hot' section of the subreddit
- The code ignores the stickied moderator posts, if any
- Posts are initially displayed without the content shown until the user clicks on the post and then the post expands to show the content

*The css is basic as the main goal was to learn react and using web data
